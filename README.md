# Debug_i8080
this project is an attempt to try my skills writing an emulator of Intel 8080 CPU and some additional stuff (can you do much with just a cpu?)
I wrote some kind of disassembler first, but it is "silly" - it can't determine jumps, that's why I swithched to emulation routines (which is not complete yet)
It's an educational project and it's not supposed to be used - at all ( i mean for now when it's not working properly :) )
